# Anomaly-detection-using-semi-supervised-learning

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying instances or observations in a dataset that differ significantly from the majority of the data, i.e., they are abnormal or anomalous. Anomalies can be caused by various factors, such as measurement errors, data corruption, fraud, or unexpected events. Anomaly detection is a common task in many fields, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, and healthcare.

Anomaly detection can be performed using various techniques, including statistical methods, machine learning, and deep learning. Statistical methods often involve defining a threshold or rule for identifying anomalies based on the statistical properties of the data. Machine learning and deep learning techniques use algorithms to learn patterns and relationships in the data and identify instances that do not fit the learned patterns.
